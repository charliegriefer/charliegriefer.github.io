This should be thrilling.

* I currently live in Peoria, Arizona, just west of Phoenix. Yes, it's rather hot here.
* I married a beautiful woman with questionable tastes in men on October 18, 1997. If you're reading this and it's close to, but not after, October 18th, give me a heads up.
* I have three amazing children who often make me very proud, and often make me very frustrated. Sometimes both at the same time.
* I work for [World Singles](http://www.worldsingles.com) as a Senior Software Engineeer. It is my dream job for a myriad of reasons.
* I <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C26IZNE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00C26IZNE&linkCode=as2&tag=charlgrief-20&linkId=NPXXTJPCOPZ3RCPR">wrote a book</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=charlgrief-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00C26IZNE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. It's not a big book, but it is a book, and I wrote it. My mom refers to me as "my son the author" amongst her mahjong group.  

## What am I doing here?

I'm a self-taught programmer who spent many years as a Web Developer using Adobe's ColdFusion. Nowadays, I'm trying to learn a bit about functional programming, and [Clojure](http://clojure.org) in particular. I thought if I blogged a bit about my journey, it might help things stick a bit better.

I have a (now defunct) blog at [http://charlie.griefer.com](http://charlie.griefer.com) that served as both a personal blog and a tech blog, mostly related to ColdFusion and jQuery. For now, I'm leaving it up for posterity. From this point forward, my technical posts will be here.

I have a personal blog at [http://www.secondhalfcharlie.com](http://www.secondhalfcharlie.com). Feel free to visit.
