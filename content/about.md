Born and raised in Edison, NJ, Charlie moved to the Phoenix, AZ area in 1995.

He's moved around a bit since then, but ultimately ended up back in Arizona where
he currently resides with his three children, three dogs, and one wife.

... and his '07 Jeep Wrangler.

By day, Charlie works for [Wrecking Ball Studio + Labs](http://www.getwrecked.com), where
he works on projects for clients such as Adobe, Bacardi, Time Warner Cable, Dolby, and others.

His toolbox currently consists of [Go](https://golang.org), [Docker](https://www.docker.com),
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com), and a few other technologies.

He used to enjoy coding [Clojure](https://clojure.org) in Emacs, and often fantasizes about learning Vim
for his daily Go usage.

By night, Charlie teaches [Krav Maga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga) and fitness classes at [REACT Defense Systems](http://reactdefense.com/wp/).

He started training in 2009, when he realized that he'd like to be around a little bit longer to see his kids grow up.
He quit smoking, started eating better, and started training.

He was asked to join the Instrutor Trainee Program in 2014, and received his instructor certification from Chief Instructor Jay Ackerman in 2015.
