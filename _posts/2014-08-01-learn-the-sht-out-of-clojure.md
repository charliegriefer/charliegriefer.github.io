I am officially declaring August as "Learn the Shit out of Clojure" month. It's not a real holiday, mind you. Banks will be open as per usual, and mail delivery will not be impacted. It's more of a personal thing. I both want to and need to make a dedicated effort to really _get_ Clojure.

As a little background, I've been trying to learn Clojure for roughly three years now. Do you know how many Clojure books I have? Pretty much all of them, with one or maybe two exceptions. In no particular order:

- [Practical Clojure](http://www.apress.com/9781430272311) (Apress)
- [Becoming Functional](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030331.do) (O'Reilly)
- [Clojure Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029786.do) (O'Reilly)
- [Clojure Programming](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920013754.do) (O'Reilly)
- [ClojureScript: Up and Running](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025139.do) (O'Reilly)
- [Programming Clojure](http://pragprog.com/book/shcloj/programming-clojure) (Pragmatic Bookshelf)
- [The Joy of Clojure](http://joyofclojure.com/) (Manning)
- [Clojure in Action](http://www.manning.com/rathore/) (Manning)

I also have a couple of O'Reilly videos both [Clojure](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030409.do) and [functional programming](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030393.do) in general.

Want to know how many of these books and videos I've started? All of them.

Want to know how many of these books and videos I've finished? NOT A ONE.

The issue, I believe, is that once I get far enough into any of the books, they start to get challenging. At that point I start thinking about other things that I should probably do, like clean the chimney flue. And I know that I'm really just procrastinating, _because we don't have a chimney_. 

So I'll move on to another book, hoping that the approach is one that I can more easily "get". And that vicious cycle continues.

It's time to stop that cycle.

My goal for this month is to finish a book. Maybe even two. But I will start a book, and I will finish a book. And when it starts to get difficult or dry, I will resolve to keep going. And I will post regular status updates here to indicate how I'm doing and what I've learned.

I decided that the first book will be [Programming Clojure](http://pragprog.com/book/shcloj/programming-clojure) by Halloway and Bedra. The first edition was the first Clojure book that I picked up, and I found the writing style easy to follow. 

After that, it's a toss-up between [Clojure Programming](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920013754.do) by Emerick, Carper, and Grand or [The Joy of Clojure](http://joyofclojure.com/) by Fogus and Houser. But I'll cross that bridge when I get there. For right now, it's time to buckle down and learn the shit out of some Clojure.
