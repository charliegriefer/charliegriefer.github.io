And so it begins. My initial foray into blogging with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). New and different, but exciting. For years, I ran [http://charlie.griefer.com](http://charlie.griefer.com) on [blog.cfc](http://www.blogcfc.com/). As I moved away from CFML development, I moved both (griefer.com) and [Second Half Charlie](http://www.secondhalfcharlie.com) over to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/). 

[http://charlie.griefer.com](http://charlie.griefer.com) has been around for a long time. It was my "everything" blog. ColdFusion. Clojure. JavaScript. But also personal posts around health and fitness, and it just never really had what I felt was a single defining personality.

I recently started [Second Half Charlie](http://www.secondhalfcharlie), which I now use for all of my personal posts. I also wanted to start blogging about programming again, but I didn't feel right continuing on with the old blog. I feel like I'm a different programmer today, and I'm certainly using much different technologies than I did a couple of years ago. I felt that a fresh start was in order.

As fate would have it, I noticed that GitHub offered [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which would allow me to host one site with my GitHub account. And while it might not be quite as personalized as http://charlie.griefer.com, I think that http://charliegriefer.github.io represents a fundamental shift in the nature of the blog. It's not meant to be an all-encompassing blog. It's meant to be about my adventures in programming. The name, I feel, reflects that.

I'm also endeavoring to challenge myself more. I want to push myself out of my comfort zones and try new things. The fact that I had to learn Jekyll in order to take advantage of GitHub Pages was a big reason that I chose to go that route. Like most learning experiences, it's been a delicate balance of frustration and excitement. I still have a way to go in learning the in-and-outs, so forgive me if you see something amiss. But rest assured, I'm working on it.

Thanks for stopping by.
