Hey Charlie! What happened to August being "Learn the Shit out of Clojure" month? We're more than a week into September. What's up?

Yes, so as it tends to do, life got in the way. Legitimately, this time. Some family matters arose that needed my attention, and still do. But that's OK.

I did manage to get [one "Learn the Shit out of Clojure" update posted](/2014/08/07/learn-clojure-update-001/) on chapters 1-3. But as the month started to draw to a close, I found myself rushing through the rest of the book in an effort to finish it and make a few more posts.  

The problem there is that I found myself turning pages for the sake of turning pages. Not because I had absorbed what was written on the page. Having a book and not having read it is bad. Having a book and rushing through it without having learned a thing is probably worse, if only because of the wasted time.  

I do have a second update to post on chapters 4-6, and will get that done soon. I'm still going to attempt to finish the book ([Programming Clojure](http://pragprog.com/book/shcloj/programming-clojure)) by the end of September, and post a third update on chapters 7-10.  

In the meantime, I'm going to supplment the book learning with some actual coding. Last week I blogged my [Fizz Buzz in Clojure](/2014/09/03/clojure-fizzbuzz/) solution, which was a lot of fun. I started off with some barely-working ugly code and documented my steps of refactoring it into something that I think worked well. Documenting those steps, I've found, is a good way for me to learn.

So once a week, likely on Fridays, I'll pick a problem either from [4clojure](https://www.4clojure.com/) or [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and blog my solution along with the steps that I took to get there.
